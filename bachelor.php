                 The main mission of the Academy is to provide the Hellenic Army with leaders versed in the military science through living in a military environment and undergoing the many-sided military and academic education.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The Cadetsâ€™ entrance to the Academy is made possible after they have successfully passed the Pan-Hellenic University Entrance Exams and achieved high grades. The Education Program lasts four years. Each academic year is divided in two semesters. The Winter Semester starts in September and ends in February, while the Spring Semester starts in March and ends in August. Each semester includes both Military and Academic Education, theoretical as well as practical.
               </p>
              <p>
                 Each Academic Year consists of 39 weeks, 26 of which are of academic nature and 13 are of purely military one. Four of these weeks are devoted to the Final Written Exams of Semesters A and B, while for 8 weeks Cadets are on a leave of absence away from the Academy.
             </p>
              <p>
                 The Academy provides Cadets with broad Academic education which both complements and broadens Military education and training.. The Academic Program includes courses from a broad field of sciences, ranging from Humanities and Social Studies to Applied Sciences, from Chemistry to History, and from Psychology to Engineering.
